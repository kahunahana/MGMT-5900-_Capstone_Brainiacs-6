## Introduction
The Capstone Project represents a culmination of innovative efforts in the field of data analysis, machine learning, and integration with various tools and APIs. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including the problem domain, analysis goals, deliverables, and integration details.

## Overview
Based on the analysis of the Look Ecommerce public dataset, our team constructed a k-means++ clustering model to enhance customer personalization capabilities of the company. The goal of this analysis is to improve customer retention, marketing segmentation, and targeting strategies to drive revenue growth.
